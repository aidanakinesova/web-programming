        <p>I’m an Emmy Award-winning journalist, perpetual explorer, & on-camera host for Travel Channel and NBC who’s traveled to 120 countries and paid rent in 7.</p><br><br>
        <p>I’m also an “experience connoisseur” who has, among other things, bungee-jumped over the Zambezi River, fished for piranhas in the Amazon, and climbed active volcanoes in Guatemala, Indonesia, and Ecuador.</p><br><br>
        <p>I’m millennial multi-hyphenate who wears many different hats. Here’s more of what I do– on and offline</p><br><br>
        <p>Best travel blog about exciting journeys into more than 130 countries across Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North to South America, and Oceania. Traveling since 1999.</p><br><br>
        <p>The greatest aspect of traveling is the ability to witness all elements of life come together into a kind of foreshortened timeline. It’s as if we are simultaneously time traveling through our past and future. Secured by its focal present, collectively combining all lessons into our own being at each point in time and in each present moment.</p><br><br>
        <p>If you have more time and really want to understand the Colosseum, I highly recommend taking a guided tour. There is little signage throughout all the monuments included in the Colosseum ticket, which means that you will have little understanding of what you are looking at unless you are listening to a podcast about the sights, or you are using a guidebook.</p>
        <p>A tour is required to see the arena floor and hypogeum, the fascinating underground area of the Colosseum.</p>
        <p>This is a great tour for anyone visiting Rome with kids, since it aims to entertain children and tell stories about ancient Rome in a way that they’re enjoyable for youngsters and adults alike.</p>
        <p>My traveling started when I quit my job and took a one-way flight from Miami to Guatemala, leaping nervously into the unknown and leaving much of my old life behind while embarking on an epic adventure around the world.</p>
