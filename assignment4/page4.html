        <p><b>Tips For Visiting The Colosseum In Rome</b></p><br><br>
        <p>The Colosseum one of the most popular sights in Rome, and one of the most recognizable landmarks in the entire world. Here are some useful tips for visiting the Colosseum!</p><br><br>
        <p>No matter if you’re a serious history buff or a Gladiator fan – you can’t miss a visit to the Colosseum on a trip to Rome. I was super excited to see the Colosseum when we were in Rome for the first time, but visiting this historic landmark can be a bit overwhelming.</p><br><br>
        <p>Italy Travel Restrictions 2022
            Italy is open to most travelers again, including American tourists. However you do need proof of your COVID-19 vaccination(s) or a negative test result before being allowed entry.</p><br><br>
        <p><b>How To Visit The Colosseum</b></p><br><br>
        <p>There are a different ways to see the Colosseum. You can simply see it from the outside (which is free), or you can book a ticket to go inside.

            If you want to go inside, you have the option to book tickets for different areas of the Colosseum.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, you can choose to visit the Colosseum independently, or join a guided tour.</p><br>
        <p><b>How Much Does Visiting The Colosseum Cost?</b></p><br>
        <p>The general admission ticket to the Colosseum is €18 (€16 + €2 online booking fee) and also includes the Roman Forum and the Palatine. With this ticket, you’ll be able to visit the first and second levels of the Colosseum, including three overlooks, however, NOT the arena level or the hypogeum, the underground area of the Colosseum. (You need to book a guided tour to visit these restricted areas – see below for more details.)</p>
