        <p>Hi, I’m João! Welcome to my blog, where I share my travel experiences and adventures in off-the-beaten-track travel destinations.</p><br><br>
        <p>You may notice that the main intention of this blog is to encourage and motivate other travelers to discover interesting and unknown places around the world.</p><br><br>
        <p>Exotic itineraries and ideas to inspire independent travelers. Are you ready to think outside the box for your next adventure?</p><br><br>
        <p>Best travel blog about exciting journeys into more than 130 countries across Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North to South America, and Oceania. Traveling since 1999.</p><br><br>
        <p>The greatest aspect of traveling is the ability to witness all elements of life come together into a kind of foreshortened timeline. It’s as if we are simultaneously time traveling through our past and future. Secured by its focal present, collectively combining all lessons into our own being at each point in time and in each present moment.</p><br><br>

    <p id="final">With a notorious passion for driving, I am emphatic about heading out on the road and traveling. With the ability to decide where to go and where to stop, I have a full sense of freedom while on the road.
        I just came back from a 35.000 km (21.750 mi) road trip with a DIY camper van. Check out this short video of driving the icy mountains of Kyrgyzstan at 3.112 m (10.210 ft)</p>
